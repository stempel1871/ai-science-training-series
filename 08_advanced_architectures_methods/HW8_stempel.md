Prompt:
What do you think is a particularly good use case for LLMs for science? How would you evaluate it? 

Response:
I going to consider my academic field (physics or generalized to physical sciences). LLM usage in physical sciences is largely limited to a "helper" role, aiding in secondary tasks required of scientists. Even so, great care needs to be used wherever an LLM is employed, checking anything generated for accuracy. I could see it helping with writing/editing, especially for those working in second languages. I could also see it being used for generating sections of trivial code for minor computational tasks. For both cases, though, the output needs to be carefully checked for accuracy, and anyone using it needs to factor this in when considering if using an LLM will actually improve their workflow.
